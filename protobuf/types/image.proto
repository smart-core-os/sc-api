// Image describes a resolution, context, aspect ratio, and source independent image.

// combination that best matches the intended output destination.

// An image is a visual representation of some subject, for example "A dog chasing it's tail, on grass".
// The subject does not change when you double the resolution, crop in landscape or square, encode using jpeg or webp,
// or serve via a url or filesystem path.
// The choice for each of these properties can only be determined at image display time, i.e. the renderer knows that
// it doesn't support webp, and the destination area is 480px wide at 1.5x pixel density.
