// HailApi describes devices that may be asked to transport passengers from one location to another.
// To interact with these devices you create a hail, a description of the origin and destination for your journey.
// The device keeps you updated on the preparation or progress of your journey by updating the fields in Hail.
//
// HailApi applies to devices like lifts or taxis, where the transportation is initiated by the caller. It does not
// apply to scheduled/regular transportation - like busses or escalators - where the presence of the passenger is not
// required.
