// VendingApi describes devices that hold an inventory and can dispense their consumables on command.
// Applies to devices like vending machines, water taps, coffee machines, and pet food dispensers.
//
// The VendingApi encodes two different resources, the consumables and the inventory.
// Consumables represent information about the products that are available from this device.
// Inventory is a measure of how many/much of the consumables are currently available.
// Quantities are non-specific, they could be discreet items like apples, or continuous like water.
// Some consumables are both discreet and continuous, you can have 0.3L or 1 cup of water.
